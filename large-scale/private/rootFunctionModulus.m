function f = rootFunctionModulus(z)
%   rootFunctionModulus:
%       This function returns abs(z) - 1.  If z is an outermost eigenvalue
%       of some matrix M, then this function returns the spectral radius of
%       matrix M minus 1.  
% 
%       If M is a discrete-time system, f will be negative when M is stable
%       system and nonnegative otherwise.  Specifically, f will be zero
%       when z is on the stability boundary (the unit circle) and will be
%       positive when z is outside the unit circle in the complex plane.

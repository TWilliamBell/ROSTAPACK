function [r,theta] = cplx2polar(z)
%   cplx2polar(z):
%       [r,theta] = cplx2polar(z)
%       Get the modulus and angle of complex number z, i.e. its polar
%       coordinates: r = abs(z) and theta = angle(z).
%
%       NOTE: Unlike MATLAB's builtin cart2pol routine, here the radius is
%       returned first and then the angle is returned.
%
%   See also polar2cplx, cart2cplx, cplx2cart, cart2polar, and polar2cart.
